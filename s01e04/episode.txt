FILENAME: steamlugcast.s01e04.makers-eden
DESCRIPTION: We’re into our fourth episode with a stab in the dark, an interview with the developers of a science‐fiction noir adventure game that’s currently going through crowd‐funding, Maker’s Eden. We also discuss the last fortnights’ events, an important announcement by Crytek, and we ponder @swordfischer’s obsession with horses. And John’s confusingly abnormal like of Bugzilla. We hope you enjoy!
