00:10:25 Did the Steam‐Runtime help?
00:11:00 How was the feedback from the Linux community?
00:12:38 Is the Linux community’s level of vocality different from the Mac community?
00:14:54 Does Linux make you a nerd or do nerds gravitate towards Linux?
00:16:12 What does your testing environment look like?
00:18:35 Do you change your testing hardware in order to reproduce issues?
00:19:41 Has this kind of thorough testing become rare in the industry?
00:21:54 How do you approach your licensees about porting to Linux/ do they approach you?
00:23:18 Is demand by Linux users going to influence which games are going to be ported in the future?
00:24:59 (How) do external porting houses interact with upstream developers?

00:32:25 What about X11 and case sensitive file systems?
