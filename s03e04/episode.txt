00:00:39 *Chat with Ryan C. Gordon*
00:00:49 Ryan's History http://icculus.org/resume
00:01:21 Loki Games http://lokigames.com/ https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_Software
00:01:42 Participated in LokiHack http://www.lokigames.com/hack/ http://www.lokigames.com/hack/patches.html
00:03:20 After demise of Loki Games in 2001, Ryan continued as a contractor, porting games to Linux & Mac OS X
00:03:34 Working at Loki Games led to the creation of some well-known open-source tools like SDL and OpenAL http://libsdl.org http://www.openal-soft.org/
00:06:32 SDL being open source has allowed contributions that enable obscure targets like Sega Dreamcast or Haiku http://haiku-os.org
00:09:29 The Humble Bundle and its Humble Indie Beginnings https://humblebundle.com
00:09:38 Humble originally hosted on wolfire.com http://wolfire.com
00:10:27 Ryan has a recommendation for Braid's inclusion in the first Humble Indie Bundle
00:15:55 Valve reaches out to Ryan for assistance porting Steam to Mac OS X https://valvesoftware.com
00:17:33 After Valve reaches their goal for a Mac version, talks of a Linux version of Steam begin
00:18:14 "Get zombies on the screen!" http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/ http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/
00:19:49 "The beginning of a very interesting time in Linux gaming."
00:20:33 Ryan's thoughts on GLNext
00:23:36 DerRidda asks what Ryan thinks of AMD's offer to donate code from Mantle to GLNext http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/amd-working-closely-with-khronos-group-on-nextgen-opengl-gives-mantle-access.4157
00:25:35 "Everything old is new again" - GLide vs. Direct3D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_API
00:29:33 Hosts a website that was once intended to act as an incubator for open source projects http://icculus.org
00:33:18 Nemoder asks about goals of icculus.org as a place for linux porters to host code
00:34:48 Cheeseness invites Ryan to talk about the impact of proprietary services on open source projects
00:36:56 "You don't really own your data. You definitely don't own the code."
