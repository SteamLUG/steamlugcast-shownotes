00:00:32 *Chat with Special Guests Stephen Alexander, Kain Shin, and Jordan Thomas of Question*
00:00:44 The Magic Circle summary
	A game about making games http://www.magiccirclegame.com/ http://store.steampowered.com/app/323380
00:01:21 Stephen and Jordan met at Irrational Games working on Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite http://irrationalgames.com/ 
00:01:47 Decided to form Question to work together on their own project http://www.questiongames.com/
00:01:59 Kain and Jordan worked together at Ion Storm on Thief: Deadly Shadows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Storm
00:02:48 Question wanted to make something less serious
00:03:24 Unity was quicker to prototype than UDK
	Attractive cost of license
00:04:14 The Magic Circle is a playful commentary on the game industry
00:09:17 Player input influences the world
00:11:28 Many possible combinations and solutions to puzzles
	Alludes to game design
00:13:14 Ending has a change in gameplay
00:16:07 Balancing story and gameplay was a unique challenge
00:18:42 @doracoder enjoyed the art and wanted to see more of the story
00:19:32 Demo includes the first 30 minutes of the game
	Saves progress to continue in full game
00:20:21 Stephen is proud of the sketch world
00:21:27 @ValiantCheese liked the spoiler!
00:22:49 Question risked being mysterious in the marketing
	Balancing presenting game's fiction and game itself
	Fictional crowdfunding webpage for game within The Magic Circle http://www.magiccirclegame.com/kickbackr
00:26:42 They always wanted to make a Linux build but did not have an install at first
00:29:15 Linux users help other Linux users in community
00:31:20 Linux sales of The Magic Circle is near the Mac sales
00:32:40 JP LeBreton (@vectorpoem) influenced the desire for a Linux port
	A character in game was made with him in mind
	@vectorpoem appeared as a guest in SteamLUG Cast [s02e16]
00:33:52 Game released in early access in May 2015 and launched in July 2015
	Linux support soon after
00:34:09 Question had a very pleasant and helpful early access experience
00:39:03 The Magic Circle has continued to receive updates
	May get more content in the future
00:43:02 Question has interest in creating a more serious game in the future
	Considering making a unique horror game
	The Magic Circle may come to console platforms
00:53:06 There are many interesting ideas that could be implemented in the game
	The challenge is choosing the correct ones
00:54:21 Stephen is the artist while being well versed in many other disciplines
00:55:37 Kain does engineering work
00:55:47 Jordan is writer, level designer, promoter; enjoys unique concepts
00:57:14 Being smaller and independent, everyone works on tasks they may be uncomfortable with
