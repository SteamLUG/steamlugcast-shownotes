00:01:52 *Chat with Special Guest Ariel from the Godot Engine*
00:02:45 Godot Engine started as a more flexible architecture in response to new hardware in 2007
00:03:44 They started working with OKAM Studio so that they could focus on the engine while the rest of the team made games
00:04:24 The engine was always intended to be open source software, but they never considered it to be ready
00:05:22 OKAM Studio's first project was a demo for The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça & Pizza Boy
	The Kickstarter campaign for the game was a last resort
00:06:45 Publishers were intrigued after the Kickstarter campaign
00:09:12 Godot Engine release on Steam provided credibility to the project
00:10:21 Demo/programmers are out of the way
00:13:49 Scumm-like high level language by accident
00:14:46 Partner at OKAM is an artist for the Dog Mendonça graphic novels
00:16:07 Description of The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça & Pizza Boy
00:18:23 While everything contributed to the Kickstarter campaign, the demo on Steam had the biggest impact
